/**
 * Where to go after signing in, when the visitor was heading somewhere.
 *
 * A public agent link lands on `/a/:slug`, which anyone can read; installing
 * needs an account, so the CTA sends them to sign in *with* the page they
 * wanted. Without this the auth screens always land on `/`, and a link shared
 * outside the platform loses its visitor at exactly the step it was meant to
 * survive.
 *
 * The whole file is really one rule: **only same-origin paths**. `?next=` is
 * attacker-controllable — it travels in a URL anyone can compose and send —
 * so a value that is not a plain in-app path is discarded rather than
 * sanitised. Three shapes are refused and each is a real open redirect:
 *
 *   `https://evil.example`  an absolute URL to somewhere else
 *   `//evil.example`        protocol-relative, which browsers resolve as above
 *   `javascript:…`          a scheme, not a path, and a script if it is ever
 *                           put in an href
 *
 * Refusing rather than repairing is deliberate: a "fixed" hostile value is
 * still a value someone chose, and the cost of discarding it is that the
 * visitor lands on the home page, which is where they would have landed
 * anyway.
