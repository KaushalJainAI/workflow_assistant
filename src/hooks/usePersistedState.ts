/**
 * `useState` that remembers its value across page switches.
 *
 * Navigating between routes unmounts a page entirely, so anything held in
 * local component state (which tab was open, which filter was applied, what
 * was typed in a search box) is lost the moment the user looks at something
 * else and comes back. This is the drop-in replacement for those cases.
 *
 * Two backing stores, because the two kinds of state expire differently:
 *   - `local`   — preferences the user chose deliberately (tab, sort, view
 *                 mode). They should still be there tomorrow.
 *   - `session` — incidental context (a search query, a scroll position).
 *                 Worth keeping while the tab is open, stale after that.
 *
 * Values round-trip through JSON, so anything stored must be serialisable.
 * A read that fails (disabled storage, corrupted entry, a shape that no
 * longer type-checks) falls back to the initial value rather than throwing —
 * persisted UI state is never important enough to break a page over.
