/**
 * Placeholder for a transcript still being fetched.

 * Only shown on a cold cache — with a cached transcript the real thing paints

 * something shaped like the answer that is coming, rather than by the agent's
 * thinking indicator, which used to run here and claimed the model was working
 * when the page was only issuing a GET.
 *
 * Deliberately built from the same geometry as a settled turn (question
 * heading, "Answer" label, body lines, 3rem between turns) so the transcript
 * replaces it in place instead of pushing it aside.
