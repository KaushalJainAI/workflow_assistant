/**
 * Logs Service — what an agent did, thought, and was configured as.
 *
 * A run is a loop of **turns**, not a list of steps: each turn is one pass of
 * the model, carrying the reasoning behind it, and the tool calls it issued
 * hang off it. Calls sharing a turn were decided together; calls in different
 * turns were not. Render them that way or the trace claims a causality the run
 * never had.
 *
 * `workflow_id` / `workflow_name` are frozen wire names. What they identify is
 * a SubAgent — the backend renames the column on the way out so that this app
 * and BrowserOS, which ship their own builds, do not have to move together.
