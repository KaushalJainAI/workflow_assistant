/**
 * The one definition of "what is waiting on you", shared by the Sidebar badge,
 * Inbox and Overview.
 *
 * Three components used to declare the same `['hitl','pending']` query with
 * three different intervals, so the effective poll rate was whichever page
 * happened to be mounted. Owning the policy here makes it one number, and lets
 * that number depend on something the individual pages cannot see: whether the
 * per-user HITL socket is live.
 *
 * When the socket is up it already pushes `new_request` and `reminder` frames
 * and invalidates this key (see useHITLReminders), so polling is only a safety
 * net for the transitions nothing pushes — a request answered on another device
 * or in BrowserOS, or one that expired. Every two minutes is enough for that.
 * When the socket is down (no Redis locally, proxy dropped the upgrade, backend
 * restarting) polling is the only channel left, so it tightens to 20s.
