## 🔴 Critical Missing Features (High Priority)

### 1. Node Configuration Panel

## Summary

Your Nexus clone has excellent foundations and some unique features (AI Builder, Documents) that the official n8n doesn't have. The main gaps are in the workflow editor experience:

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| **UI Design** | ✅ Excellent - modern and clean |
| **Page Structure** | ✅ Complete |
| **Node Library** | ⚠️ Basic (~20 nodes) |
| **Editor Features** | ⚠️ Missing critical features |
| **Execution View** | ⚠️ Logs only, no data |
| **Unique Features** | ✅ AI Builder is great |

Focus on the workflow editor improvements first, as that's where users will spend most of their time.
