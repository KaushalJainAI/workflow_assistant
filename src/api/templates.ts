/**
 * Explore — everything installable, and publishing into it.
 *
 * Two sources, one shape. A **curated** entry is code on the backend
 * (`agents/gallery.py`); a **community** entry is an agent another user
 * published. They differ in provenance and in nothing the installer cares
 * about, so this file has one type for both and `source` says which it is.
 *
 * The only writes are `install`, which creates an ordinary agent that the
 * entry then has no further hold over, and `publish`, which turns one of your
 * own agents into a listing.
 *
 * `config` is a partial `AgentConfig` — the same shape the builder speaks —
 * and the install screen renders its permissions straight from it. That is
 * deliberate: the screen and the runtime read the same keys, so the screen
 * cannot promise something the runtime never checks.
