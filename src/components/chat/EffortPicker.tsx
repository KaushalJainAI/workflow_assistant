/**
 * How hard the selected model is asked to think.
 *
 * Its own component rather than more JSX inside the model dropdown, for the
 * reason `ThinkingTimer` is its own component: `StandaloneChat` is already the
 * largest file on the route, and this control re-renders on a state that
 * nothing else in that tree reads.
 *
 * The one rule it enforces visually: **a model with no effort control shows no
 * control at all**, rather than a disabled row or a set of greyed rungs. Which
 * rungs exist is a per-model fact the server sends (`AIModel.effort_levels`),
 * and rendering a knob that cannot move is how a user comes to believe a
 * setting applied when it never did.
