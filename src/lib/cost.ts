 * turns, on the agent list and in Overview, and a cost that reads `₹0.02` in
 * one place and `$0.0002` in another is a cost nobody trusts. The backend does
 * every piece of arithmetic (`llm/pricing.py`); this only formats, deliberately
 * — a second implementation of the math in TypeScript is exactly the drift
 * `agents/spend.py` exists to document.
 *
 * The rule that matters more than the formatting: **`unpriced` is not zero.**
 * It means no price is on record for the model the run used, so we do not know
 * what it cost. Printing `₹0.00` there would claim the run was free, which is
 * the one thing we are sure it was not.
