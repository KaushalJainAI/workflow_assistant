 * HITL: the pending queue and the response that resumes a run.
 *
 * This used to also carry execution control (execute / status / pause / resume
 * / stop), deploy / undeploy, partial "test step" runs, AI authoring
 * (generate / modify / suggest), thought history and background tasks. Those
 * endpoints were deleted with the workflow canvas that was their only caller,
 * so the methods went with them rather than being left to 404. Agent execution
 * lives in `./agents`. The builder chat transcript (`/orchestrator/chat/`) went
 * the same way on 2026-09-19: its POST stored a message and never answered.

/**
 * One button on a pending request.

 * The backend writes these as `{label, value}` — the label is what the button
 * says, the value is what the response posts. This was typed `string[]` for as
 * long as the queue existed, which was survivable only because nothing wrote a
 * row: React refuses an object as a child, so the first genuine request took
 * the Inbox detail pane into the error boundary.
 *
 * A bare string is still accepted. Rows written before `open_request` existed
 * carry them, and `options` is a free JSON column that other writers may reach.
